1. This Configuration doesn't Guarantee that it will work in your setup. If contacted for some help for configuration then I may probably help during my free time

2. This Configuration is basically forked from Harun Yayli's original codes to check Memcached stats.

3. You are free to use this and distribute. If you charge your customer while using this setup then it may not cost you more to Buy Me a Mug of Beer, please feel free to send. I promise to send half of the mug to [Harun Yayli](http://livebookmark.net/journal/about/).
